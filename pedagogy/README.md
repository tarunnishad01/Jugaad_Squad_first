#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  : Simulation-Based Learning   
###### Assessment Method:: Practical simulation exercises followed by quizzes and discussions.

<u> <b>Description: </b>    </u>
<br>
    This strategy involves using simulation software to model amplifier circuits, allowing students to visualize and analyze circuit behavior without the need for physical components. It encourages active learning through experimentation and fosters a deeper understanding of amplifier design and analysis.
