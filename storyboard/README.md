#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
Upon launching the simulator, the user is presented with a clean workspace featuring a virtual breadboard, a component toolbar, and a simulation control panel. The workspace is set against a neutral background to minimize distractions. The component toolbar includes elements like resistors, capacitors, operational amplifiers, and signal sources. The simulation control panel offers options to run, pause, and reset the simulation, as well as to visualize waveforms and adjust parameters.
#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
The primary objective of this experiment is to design and simulate an amplifier circuit, analyze its frequency response, and assess its performance under different conditions. The user will begin by selecting appropriate components from the toolbar and assembling them on the virtual breadboard. After configuring the circuit, the user will run the simulation to observe the output waveforms and make necessary adjustments to achieve desired specifications. The goal is to understand how component values influence amplifier behavior and to develop skills in circuit simulation and analysis.
#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

Component Selection: User selects components from the panel (resistors, capacitors, op-amps). Circuit Building: User places components and makes connections on the digital workspace. Parameter Configuration: User assigns values (resistance, capacitance, input voltage). Simulation Execution: User runs the simulation to observe output characteristics. Analysis and Feedback: Output is displayed graphically, and feedback is provided. Design Optimization: User iteratively updates circuit design to meet goals

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:
Challenge 1: Achieving the desired gain with minimal distortion. The user must experiment with different resistor and capacitor values to find an optimal configuration.
Challenge 2: Understanding the impact of component tolerances on circuit performance. The user can simulate variations in component values to observe their effects.
Challenge 3: Designing a circuit that meets specific frequency response requirements. The user must adjust component values to achieve the desired bandwidth and phase margin.

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
Pitfall 1: Incorrect component placement leading to circuit malfunction. The simulator provides visual feedback to help the user identify and correct such errors. Pitfall 2: Overdriving the amplifier, resulting in clipping or distortion. The user is encouraged to monitor output waveforms and adjust input levels accordingly. Pitfall 3: Neglecting to account for parasitic elements like stray capacitance, which can affect high-frequency performance. The simulator may highlight such effects to raise awareness
##### 2.6 Conclusion:
upon completing the experiment, the user will have gained practical experience in designing and simulating amplifier circuits. They will understand how component values influence amplifier performance and how to optimize circuits to meet specific requirements. The simulator's real-time feedback and analysis tools will have facilitated a deeper comprehension of amplifier behavior, preparing the user for more advanced topics in electronics.

### 3. Flowchart
Link to flow chart Here : Store in the  /flowchart folder within pedagogy folder in your repo
<br>
(Guide :The lab proposer should extract logic from the story, prepare a flowchart from the story narration and write the algorithm to execute the black box.  use Google Drawings https://docs.google.com/drawings/ (send the link to your flowchart and also attach .png by exporting it )

### 4. Mindmap
 Link to mindmap here : Store the mindmap in both .mm & .png extension in the  /mindmap folder and include link of only .pdf verison here
 <br>
 (Guide : An elaborate mind map (connecting all the points in the experiment flow ) should be prepared and submitted by the lab proposer. The mind map should be a clear and detailed document that takes into account all minute intri5acies involved in the development of virtual lab. The mindmap should be self-content and any developer across the globe should be able to code it with all those details. using only FreeMind http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page (send the .png file and also the original .mm extension project file. )
