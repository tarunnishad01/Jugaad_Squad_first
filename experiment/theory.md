🔍 Introduction
Amplifiers are fundamental electronic components used to increase the amplitude of input signals without altering their other characteristics significantly. In electronics, amplifier circuits are used in almost every application—from audio devices and communication systems to control systems and instrumentation.

This experiment allows users to simulate and build amplifier circuits virtually using an interactive platform. It aims to help learners understand the behavior, design, and frequency response of different amplifier configurations such as common emitter amplifiers, op-amp circuits, and differential amplifiers.

🎯 Objective
To understand the working principles of different amplifier circuits.

To build and simulate custom amplifier circuits.

To observe the input-output waveform and frequency response.

To analyze gain, bandwidth, phase shift, and distortion characteristics.

🧠 Basic Concepts
1. Amplifier
An amplifier is an electronic device that increases the power of a signal. It does this using an external power source and is characterized by gain, the ratio of output signal to input signal.

2. Types of Amplifiers
Common Emitter (CE) Amplifier – Provides voltage gain and moderate input/output impedance.

Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) – A high-gain voltage amplifier with differential input and typically single-ended output.

Differential Amplifier – Amplifies the difference between two input voltages and rejects common-mode signals.

3. Key Parameters
Voltage Gain (Av) = Vout / Vin

Bandwidth – The range of frequencies over which the amplifier operates effectively.

Input/Output Impedance – Determines how the amplifier interacts with the source/load.

Phase Shift – The amount by which the output signal is shifted in time relative to the input.

🔌 Amplifier Configurations
✦ Common Emitter Amplifier
Uses a single BJT transistor.

Input is applied at the base, and output is taken from the collector.

Offers high gain, inverted output, and good linearity.

✦ Inverting and Non-Inverting Op-Amp
Inverting: Output is 180° out of phase with input, high gain controlled by feedback resistors.

Non-Inverting: Output in phase with input, gain = (1 + Rf/Rin).

Used for precise amplification in analog signal processing.

✦ Differential Amplifier
Amplifies difference between two inputs.

High common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR).

Found in sensor front-ends and analog front-end systems.

🛠 Simulation Focus
In this virtual experiment:

Users will drag and connect components like resistors, capacitors, transistors, and op-amps.

Apply AC or DC inputs, adjust parameters like supply voltage and component values.

Observe output waveform using simulated oscilloscopes and Bode plots.

Compare linear vs. non-linear behavior depending on input amplitude and circuit configuration.

📈 Expected Outcomes
Understand the effect of biasing and component values on gain and stability.

Visualize how capacitive coupling and bypass capacitors affect frequency response.

Gain experience in troubleshooting amplifier circuits by modifying connections.

Identify how different amplifier designs behave under various loading conditions.

📘 Conclusion
Simulating amplifier circuits provides a risk-free, flexible platform for learning analog electronics. It bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation, helping learners explore real-world behaviors such as saturation, distortion, bandwidth limits, and frequency response tuning.
