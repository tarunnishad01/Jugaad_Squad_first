Amplifiers are fundamental building blocks in analog electronics, designed to increase the amplitude of input signals. They are characterized by parameters like gain, input/output impedance, frequency response, and efficiency.

ðŸ”¸ Types of Amplifiers:
BJT Amplifiers:

Common Emitter (CE): High voltage gain, moderate input and output impedance, inverts signal.

Common Collector (CC): Also known as emitter follower; high input, low output impedance.

Common Base (CB): Low input impedance, high output impedance, used in high-frequency applications.

Op-Amp Based Amplifiers:

Inverting amplifier

Non-inverting amplifier

Differential amplifier

Integrator/Differentiator

ðŸ”¸ Key Parameters:
Voltage Gain (Av) = Vout / Vin

Bandwidth

Input and Output Impedance

Signal Distortion
